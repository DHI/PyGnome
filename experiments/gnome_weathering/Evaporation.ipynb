    "I (nor Robert) am not sure there is a basius for this -- water evaporated faster with sea spray, which I think is where Bill got the idea an coeff, but oil is no linger a surface film under these conditions, so who the heck knows? and if anything, I might expect morre atomization of the oil, rather than evaporation -- some of Joe Katz' work, and other GOMRI folks seem to indicate that.\n",
