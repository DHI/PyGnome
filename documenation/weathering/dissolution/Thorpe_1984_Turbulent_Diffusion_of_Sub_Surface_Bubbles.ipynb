    "Bubbles produced by breaking wind waves are carried by turbulence below the sea surface.  In an earlier model of the distribution of bubble sizes with depth it was necessary to neglect certain terms in order to formulate a differential equation which was solved numerically.\n",
    "A model is devised in which this procedure is avoided.  Turbulence is represented by a random walk or Monte Carlo simulation, and each bubble introduced at the surface is followed and a tally kept on its changing radius.  Bubbles are continually introduced until a steady state is reached, when the distributions, gas fluxes, and acoustic scattering cross-sections are calculated.\n",
    "The results are compqared with camera observations reported by Johnson and Cooke.  The major contribution to both gas flux and to the acoustic scattering cross-section per unit volume at sonar frequencies of 248 KHz (corresponding to that which we have used to observe bubbles) comes from bubbles which, at the surfeace, have radii between ~40 and 100 $\\mu$m.\n",
    "The model successfully reproduces the variation of the total number of bubbles with depth, but fails to describe the observed shape of the size distribution.  Factors contributing to this discrepancy are discussed.  It is possible that bubble populations measured by floating cameras are biased because of the effects of Langmuir circulation both on the float and on the bubbles."

    "Subsurface bubbles formed by breaking wind waves have been subject to investigation for some time, primarily because of their role in the formation of aerosols when the bubbles burst on returning to the surface (Blanchard and Woodcock, 1957; Mason, 1971), but also because of their effect on underwater sound propagation (Urick, 1975), their action in scavenging particles or of creating particle amalgams when they dissolve (Johnson and Cooke, 1980), their production of foam (their surface counterpart, Monahan and O'Muircheartaigh, 1980) and their presence in spilling breakers (Longuet-Higgins and Turner, 1974).\n",
    "Interest in the downward diffusion of bubbles by turbulence, and the physics of \"bubble clouds\", has recently been excited by the discovery that they can be detected by subsurface, upward-pointing, sonar (Aleksandrov and Vaindruk, 1974; Thorpe, 1982, hereafter referred to as I; Thorpe and Hall, 1983).\n",
    "There is a need to devise reliable models of the bubbles if the sonar measurements are to be used to infer characteristics of the turbulence (Thorpe, 1984a) or the gas flux carried into the water via the bubbles (Thorpe, 1984b)."

    "The equations representing the dynamics of bubbles, formulated in terms of their mean size distribution per unit  volume and unit radius $N(a, z)$, where $a$ is the radius of a bubble $z$, were described by Garrettson (1973). In I the equations, in particular the terms representing the flux of $N$ in radius space, were simplified by making assumptions about the relative scales over which contributing terms were supposed to vary and by neglecting terms representing bubble accelerations.\n",
    "Although these assumptions appeared reasonable, some doubt remained about their validity.  There was also difficulty in modeling bubbles composed of more than one gas.  We have therefore devised a more direct means of modeling the bubbles, one in which each bubble is represented by a particle, the motion of which is described using a Monte Carlo simulation.\n",
    "This formulation has the advantage that fluxes can be better represented, bubble composition can vary, and mean flows can easily be included.  One such type of flow is that due to Langmuir circulations (Leibovich, 1983) and this aspect of the model will be described elsewhere (Thorpe, 1984c).  The present formulation has the disadvantage of being appropriate only when the diffusion coefficient is uniform in depth.\n",
    "The technique of simulating a turbulent flow by random motioins and of following individual particles is not new, but it appears not to have been tried before in this context and, as we have mentioned, avoids difficulties inherent in other methods."

Bubble size distributions were reported at three depths (0.7m, 1.8m, and 4.0m), in winds of 11-13 $m / s$.  The distributions peaked at all depths at radii of about $50 \\mu m$, and the numbers decreased rapidly on either side of the peak and also rapidly with depth.  The camera could not resolve bubbles smaller than $17 \\mu m$.\n",
