# Documents the packages required for PyGnome
# In theory, you should be abel t install all this with:
# pip install -r requirements.txt
# in practice, most of these packages are pip-installable, but not all.
#
# we recommend using teh conda package mangement system -- it better supports complex
# binary packages, and we are supporting it
# the "InstallingWithAnaconda.rst" file for details

## dependencies that aren't on PyPi
git+https://github.com/NOAA-ORR-ERD/PyNUCOS.git@v2.6.1#egg=unit_conversion
git+https://github.com/NOAA-ORR-ERD/OilLibrary.git@v1.0.0#egg=oil_library



## py_gd requires the libgd graphics rendering library
## This may be easy to get for Linux, but on OS-X and Windows, you are better off using conda
git+https://github.com/NOAA-ORR-ERD/py_gd.git@v0.1.8.1#egg=py_gd


##    BINARY dependencies: probably cannot be pip installed
##    Following packages requires something more than pip install
##    since they have binary dependencies. Following packages are commented
##    so pip does not try to install them. Please look at install directions
##    in README.md for instructions on installing for your OS.
##    NOTE: these come with conda and EPD, for isntance.
