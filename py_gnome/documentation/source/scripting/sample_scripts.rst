Sample Scripts Included with PyGNOME
====================================

A good way to learn to use PyGNOME is to find an example script that uses similar components 
to what you need, and use that as a starting point. the Sample scripts can be found in 
the ``py_gnome/scripts`` dir, in directories named ``script_*``.

There are also a few utilities in the ``scripts`` directory:

``script_runner.py`` will run a particular script, with various options for output: image output, netcdf output, saving to a "save file", or reloading from a "save file". try::

    $ python script_runner -h for help

``run_all.py`` will run all the scripts in the directory -- good for testing.


Below are summaries of a few of them:

``script_marianas``
--------------------

This script used current from the Navy's HYCOM model, subsetted to a region around the Marianas Islands. 
The land-water map is a BNA pulled from the GOODS shoreline extractor, with a map_bounds hand added 
to a larger region.

``script_boston``
------------------
This script models the Boston & Vicinty location file which includes a component mover.

``script_long_island``
-----------------------
This script models the Long Island location file - a single cats pattern, wind, and diffusion.

``script_chesapeake_bay``
--------------------------
This script uses a gridded time dependent current pattern for Chesapeake Bay.   

``script_passamaquoddy``
--------------------------
This script uses the current cycle mover for Passamaquoddy Bay - a set of representative patterns
driven by a tide.
    
``script_mariana``
-------------------           

``script_guam``
----------------

``script_mississippi_river``

``script_weatherers``
