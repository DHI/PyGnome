Installing
##########

PyGnome consists of compiled C++ code (`libgnome`), compiled Cython code (`*.pyx` files), and compiled python extensions.
It can be installed either from source, in which case you'll need an appropriate compiler, or from binaries provided by NOAA. However, note that at this time, NOAA is not maintaining current binaries.

Dependencies
============
pyGNOME depends on a number of third party packages -- the complete list can be found in the `requirements.txt` file.

There are many dependencies that can be hard to build, so the easiest way is to use the conda package manager, but you can do it by hand as well -- see below.
