'''
This module was originally intended to hold classes that initialize weathering
data arrays that are not set by any weathering process. It was also meant to
update the intrinsic properties of the LEs, hence the name 'intrinsic.py'
However, it sets and updates weathering data arrays including intrinsic data
like 'viscosity', 'density' and other data. Call the class WeatheringData()
which is defined in a gnome model if there are weatherers defined.

For now just define a FayGravityInertial class here
It is only used by WeatheringData to update the 'area' and related arrays
